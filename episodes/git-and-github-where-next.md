## Git and GitHub - where next?

Git and GitHub are very feature-rich tools and there's far more to learn than
the very basic usage we've covered in this short session. Indeed it's possible
to use these tools extensively in real-world projects and still be learning new
things regularly.

#### Git:

 - **Branches:** 

 - **Merging:**

 - **Conflicts:**

 - **Collaborative material development:** 

#### GitHub:

 - **Pull requests:** 

 - **Issues:** 

 - **Forks:** 

 - **GitHub actions:** If you're using GitHub for developing software, GitHub
   Actions provides an advanced environment for running a number of automated
   tasks on the code in your repository.

 - **Projects:** 

 - **Wiki:** 

 - **GitHub Pages:**

## Further training opportunities and resources

There are various resources available from documentation to training courses
(both taught and self-paced) that can help you to develop your git and GitHub
knowledge. Here are few options:

**Online documentation, info and other materials:**

 - [Git introductory videos](https://git-scm.com/videos): A great way to get a
   slightly different (and more detailed) perspective on the background of git,
   what version control is and how it can help you.

 - [The git book (Pro Git)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2): Available online
   under a Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike licence. A
   detailed reference to git from the basics through to much more advanced
   topics, and some content on using GitHub.

 - [Git command reference](https://git-scm.com/docs)

 - [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en): GitHub's detailed documentation
   website.
 
 - [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/): Regular articles covering GitHub,
   platform features and related software development topics.


**Training courses:**

 - [Version Control with Git course](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
   (Software Carpentry): This is [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)
   introductory git course covering the basics of Git and GitHub in 3+ hours of
   material. This can be covered as a self-learning course or through attending
   a [taught Software Carpentry
   course](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/workshops-upcoming/) which
   also includes an introduction to 
   the bash shell and a programming language (either Python or R).

 - CodeRefinery's [introduction to version control
   course](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/): This is taught as a
   2-day course but material can also be easily worked through online.

 - CodeRefinery's [Collaborative distributed version
   control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/) course: This
   course adds another day of more advanced material on top of the introductory
   course mentioned above.

 - [Software Development Using Git and
   GitHub](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/14-collaboration-using-git.html):
   An episode of the [Intermediate Research Software
   Development](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/)
   course within the [Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries-incubator.org/).
