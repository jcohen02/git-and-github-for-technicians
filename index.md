### Introduction to git and GitHub for technicians

Welcome to this material providing a very brief introduction to [git][git] and [GitHub][github],
aimed at technicians. This online lesson content has been prepared using the [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench]. 


#### ByteSized Training Format

This session follows the ByteSized short-format technical training structure
developed for sessions run under the [UNIVERSE-HPC][uhpc] project.

The general structure of the session is as follows:
 
 - **Part 1: Introductory presentation**

   The instructor will run through a short lecture-style presentation with some
   core background material and details of the session aims.

 - **Part 2: Interactive tutorial**

   An interactive tutorial that will give you some hands-on experience of the
   material introduced in the introductory talk.

 - **Part 3: Q&A / discussion**

   While the session is intended to be quite interactive and we encourage
   participants to ask questions during parts 1 and 2 of the session, this
   final part provides some dedicated time for discussion and the opportunity
   for participants to ask questions about more advanced aspects of the topic
   or advice relating to specific use cases that they have.
