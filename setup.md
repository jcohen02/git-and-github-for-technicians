## Prerequisites / setup information

As noted in the information sent out prior to the session, you need some
tools installed on your computer in order to participate in the interactive
tutorial element of the session.

The details provided are as follows:

##### Terminal and git

1)  You will need access to a **terminal** (sometimes called a shell) and **git** on
    your computer.

    If you are using **_Windows_**:
      - Install “[git for windows][gitforwindows]” which will provide both git and a terminal
        (the Git Bash application).

    <br/>
    If you are using **_Linux_** or **_Mac_**:
      - A terminal is available by default and git may also be installed. If
        it’s not, see the [git installation][git-install] instructions for help.
 
    <br/>
    **How to check if git is installed and available on your computer:**
      - Open a terminal window:
      - For macOS users, open Terminal.app from your Applications folder.
      - For Windows users, if you’ve installed git for windows, open the “Git
        Bash” application. 
      - (if you’ve never used a terminal before, you can exit it by simply
        typing “exit” - without the quotes – and pressing Enter/Return)

      - Run the command `git --version` at the terminal prompt (without the quotes).
      - If you see something like `git version 2.51.1` (the version number on
        your system may well be different), then you’re ready to go!
      - If you see something like `git: Command not found.`, then git has not
        been successfully installed.
 
##### GitHub.com Account

2) Sign up for a GitHub account if you don’t already have one:

    Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) and click sign up at the top
    right of the page.

    One you’ve created an account, you will have a basic, free GitHub account
    which will work fine for the purposes of this session.
    
    Many universities/research organisations have a GitHub subscription and an
    associated institutional “GitHub organisation” that you can join. Check
    relevant institutional web pages or perhaps ask a colleague whether your
    organisation has its own GitHub organisation. Institutional GitHub
    organisations are often linked to a GitHub Enterprise account that may
    offer additional features and functionality.
